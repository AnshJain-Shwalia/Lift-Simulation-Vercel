# Lift-Simulation

This project is a Lift Simulator that, upon receiving the number of floors and lifts as input, generates an interface with the corresponding number of lifts and floors. This simulator demonstrates the lift movements in response to button presses.

This version, built using React, is an improvement over [V1](https://github.com/AnshJain-Shwalia/Lift-Simulation). It features a more intuitive and user-friendly UI, is responsive and mobile-friendly, and includes an improved multi-lift scheduling algorithm that selects and schedules the best available elevator to respond to a button press.

In this version, elevators share common up and down buttons on each floor, and the multi-lift scheduling algorithm determines which elevator will respond.

This is V2, hosted [here](https://lift-simulation-lilac-two.vercel.app/).
